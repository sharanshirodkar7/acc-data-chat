Overview
The Grapevine is a micro-server that you can be load with content and displayed as a website. These completely off-line websites can be accessed by WiFi-equipped phones and computers, making content available regardless of internet availability and security restrictions. Content distributed through a Grapevine can be audio, text or video, and can be viewed or downloaded on the page. With a broadcast range of 30 feet and the ability to operate on a battery, the Grapevine can be used in in rural locations with limited electricity or internet connectivity.
Grapevine devices have been used by field workers in a variety of applications. Several seminaries use the device to offer online-style classes to students not able to physically attend class. Students are able to access course material, lectures and exams through the Grapevine which increases the amount of classes the school is able to offer. Grapevines are also being used to share information and resources to people at church network gatherings, or designated locations. Because the Grapevine is not connected to the internet, users can connect and access information discretely without being detected or monitored by government agencies or local officials.
These devices are made available through an organization called 100Fold Ministries. 100Fold Ministry’s mission is to create technology to reach the unreached. For more information on the Grapevine, check out the links below or contact the Scripture Engagement team.

A Presentation to the Academic Forum Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics, SIL Duncanville, TX
August 25, 2003
My topic, “Documenting the Effectiveness of the Oral Bible and Training by Oral Methods,” was suggested by Les Bruce. It is one I am glad to address. The topic raises a number of key questions, more than I can address in one presentation. Today I’d like to address two of them, primarily. The first question is simply, “what is the oral Bible?” The second key question about the effectiveness of oral training is this, “Effective in comparison to what?” I’ll try to answer these questions and give a significant number of from-the-field reports of the use of Bible storying in ministry and let you make some judgments for yourself about the effectiveness of it.
Oral Bible Defined
Jim Slack has defined “oral Bible” this way: “An oral Bible is the accumulated
Bible stories that have been storied to an oral communicator and that can be recalled by memory.”1 I suspect that many people working in the translation community—and others, too--do not think of “oral Bible” in this restricted sense. People are more likely to think an “oral Bible” is a complete Bible distributed in audio form, such as on audiocassettes, CDs, or other electronic means. Alexander Scourby’s reading of the King James Version of the Bible is one such product. Those of us involved in Bible storying are grateful for such products, and recognize a complete, aurally accessible Scripture as a valuable resource, but frankly speaking, we do not envision creating a Scourby-like recording of the whole Bible in any language. Would anyone still be listening after Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy?
A recorded reading of the whole Bible is not what we have in mind when we speak of an “oral Bible.” As Slack’s definition implies, storyers typically use the term to refer to the ever-accumulating reservoir of Bible stories that an individual or group has acquired via oral/aural means such as live storytelling, story songs, radio broadcasts,
1 James B. Slack, Jr., J. O. Terry, and Grant Lovejoy, “Chronological Bible Storying,” (2002 SWBTS ed.), X:4.
 
recorded stories, and such like. We may say that a particular group or individual has an “oral Bible” consisting of twelve or thirty or one hundred and thirty-five Bible stories. In saying this we are not latter-day Marcionites out to whittle down the Bible to fit our prejudices. We are speaking functionally of the group’s working, accessible canon of Scripture. For oral peoples and oral cultures, the only accessible Bible is the one that they carry in their minds (unless they have tapes, CDs, etc.). This is obviously a Scriptures in use issue. People can only live out the biblical truth that they have in their minds. This amount of truth is their entire Bible, functionally speaking.
But an “oral Bible” is not simply the amount of Bible that the group has heard. Having heard it does not necessarily make it a part of their oral Bible. Our concern is how much of the Bible they can recall at any given moment in order to make a decision, give counsel, encourage themselves in God’s truth, witness, preach, and all of the other activities of life that need to be influenced by God’s revelation. Slack’s definition also alludes to the difference between the Bible “storied” to people and the Bible as it comes via literate styles of communication. In my presentation to the Non-Print Media Conference in 1999 in Nairobi I insisted that a written document that is voiced is still perceived as a print form of communication—like a lecture being read. Admittedly, it is possible to create an oral style of discourse and then put that oral style to paper or in electronic storage. (We are encouraged that some members of the translation community have picked up on this distinction and are already strategizing how to produce translations that have an oral quality appropriate to the host culture.) Then, as now, however, we need to continue to spread the message that what we envision as an “oral Bible” cannot be accomplished simply by reading literature aloud. We must put the Bible in genuinely oral style and transmit it to people orally/aurally. When they can reproduce it from memory in an oral style, then they have the beginnings of an oral Bible. Ideally they will keep adding to their oral Bible throughout their Christian life. Any comprehensive ministry strategy based on the oral Bible must build in means of continuing to introduce new stories into the churches. Fresh stories are critical both for the ongoing growth of the group spiritually as well as the interest stimulated by new stories.
“Effectiveness” in Perspective

Christians in the West, who have long had the whole Bible in their languages, have natural reservations about this oral Bible approach. “How can you give people so little Bible—only forty Bible stories? How will they ever live a faithful Christian life if they don’t have the whole Bible?” This brings me to the second of the questions I want to address: “effective compared to what?” Think about the typical members of your home church. How much Bible do they have committed to memory? How much of Scripture is available in their minds for the Holy Spirit to use to guide them in their day-to-day decisions? How many of them have an intimate knowledge of Romans, or Jude, or Genesis and Exodus? From such a perspective, it seems highly likely that an oral people who master, say, forty stories, carefully chosen for maximum theological content and cultural relevance, can at least be on par with average churchgoers in the West, especially if they can link all forty into a single comprehensive story from creation to last things.
Additionally, we can also ask “effective compared to what?” with respect to alternative ways of evangelizing, discipling, and training illiterate peoples. The appeal of the oral Bible strategy grows stronger when you consider what the other alternatives involve, such as creating written languages where there are none; translating, testing, revising, retesting, and publishing print scriptures; creating a desire for literacy where there is little enthusiasm for it, building literacy skills to the point that new readers can understand literature written thousands of years ago using sometimes-foreign literary and cultural references; then keeping all of that alive while establishing training schools, writing textbooks, creating curricula and preparing examinations, etc. Having done all of that, then all that is left to do is to train nationals who can sustain and extend all of that themselves. And did I mention anything about fund-raising?
We know very well how much effort this latter approach takes, and we know the mixed results. There are success stories, to be sure. Thank God for every one of them. But one of the reasons people are taking a long look at oral strategies is that we do realize that the Scriptures in use question keeps popping up. Using literate approaches to initiate ministry among oral peoples is an uphill battle. There are enough encouraging stories where oral Bible strategies are being used that we keep moving toward oral strategies. First let’s consider what sixty Nigerian seminary students reported when they used their newly-acquired Bible storying instruction. They had had one week of intensive modeling

and discussion before going to a place of their choosing and telling a story of their choosing. After another week of instruction, they conducted a second Bible storying session. Here are excerpts from selected reports.
Student 1 (B.Th. 2)
Because of the previous story he had told, he found that the children arrived early for the story. After greeting them, he decided to review the story of the previous week to see if they remembered it. “To my greatest surprise about sixty-five percent (65%) of them remembered the topic of the story.” He announced the topic of the next story. “I could see their patience, attention, and listening attentively being different from what I was experiencing before, like shouting, fighting, [and] unnecessary noise. This was not manifest at all because all of them wanted to answer the listening task, in which they did very well. At the end of it one of them asked me two questions which I do not expect from children. [why Jesus’ parents thought he was in the crowd traveling home; how did Jesus know about the kingdom of God?] The lesson I learnt from this Bible storying telling is that it will make you to prepare very well, be inquisitive and it usually lasts long in the children’s memory.” At the second session on which he reported (after this one) he found the same results, noting particularly the children’s cooperativeness in raising hands before answering questions. They asked him to promise to tell the stories each week and he agreed.
Student 2 (B.Th. 3)
Used CBS in Sunday School in a mission congregation in ____. There were 39 adults and 32 children present. The church is composed of farmers who cannot read or write.
After asking about their creations stories and getting no response, he told the Yoruba creation story, then the biblical story of the creation of angelic beings. He asked for someone to retell it and they did. “It was thrilling to me that someone was able to tell the story and others made corrections. I was realizing that the CBS approach will be the best for them. . . . The people were very eager to hear more of the stories. This is because when they began to ask questions that were beyond the story, I did not answer [their questions] but simply told them that as I tell more stories, you will discover that yourself. Their response was, ‘We will come because we like this method.’ . . . I have come to

understand that they are more open to ask questions with this method, unlike when I was using the Nigerian Baptist Convention Adult Sunday School book. Even the children— who I have a problem of who will tell them—were answering questions. So it is good for the children too. I have decided to train someone by sharing the story on Saturday with the person so that he or she can share with them on Sunday. . . . I also discovered as I asked questions and from their questions that they are still holding on to their previous teachings of worshipping angels because some joined us coming from the Aladura churches. It now gave me the opportunity to explain to them things on this issue which I do not even normally preach on. To them the angels are from heaven and can reach God better, so we can pass through them to God. This session has further taught me that they have not been understanding my topical sermons.” After his second session with him, he commented, “Some of the questions during the session have made me to understand that they have not understood many things from the Bible for this three years [that he has been their pastor]. The storying method is best. . . . I have learnt to be patient with learners and not to condemn rashly when they give some ‘stupid’ answers that are not relevant to what we are discussing. This has encouraged most who didn’t use to respond to questions to do so now.”
Student 3 (M.Div. M2)
Told to teenagers at _____ Baptist Church
Began with the creation story, assuming all of them knew it. “But I soon realized I was making a mistake. They did not know the story as I expected. They payed close attention as the story is being told.” They had no questions to ask and did not respond to his questions, so he retold the story and asked them to retell. Still no response. He retold it scene by scene and some then were able to retell one scene at a time. “I discovered that the members, though church members and some of them village secondary school students [where religion is taught], did not know the story that is fundamental in the Bible. I also found out that one will be making a big mistake by assuming the Bible storying method is too simple for church people. My experience with this group of teenagers proved this to be true. . . . I also learned that I made some mistake in the discussion period. The questions asked were not too simple initially for beginners. This was so because I over estimated their growth in the Lord.” Our class discussion the

following week gave him good help in dealing with this problem. The next week he met with the teenagers again (12 of them). When he began review of the themes from the previous story, “The enthusiasm of the members in answer the questions given was amazing. The group generally was more responsive. Some of them were able to retell the previous story.” Using a listening task and sequencing the questions from fact/discovery/application really helped, though few answered the application questions.
Student 4. (B.Th. 2)
Discipleship programme during a vigil
“Immediately they heard it was a story that I was telling them, they all kept calm to hear it because they thought all I will say is outside the Bible. . . . The teaching time was lively and everybody took active part in it and they all request for more; I notice that this is their first experience of having such teaching method. I promise them that we shall continue to have such a programme from time to time. The story method makes the people to be active in thinking and contribution. It is not teacher oriented. It also helps them to think deeply and reflect on life, to discover some facts. . . . They asked some sharp questions which are technical to answer. . . . I wish we could get much time for such teaching approach any other time because it makes them to be more active and concentrated on the story.”
Student 5 (Dip.Th. 2)
He told the story of Elijah and the prophets of Baal at E_____ Diaspora church on his first visit to there. He was new and so was his method. He told it just before the Sunday School lesson started.
“As I started the storying, their attention was focused on this story, forgetting about the Sunday School, as they knew that something new was coming out of that story. They were so attentive, better than in the Sunday School or to the sermon. Even the children listened very attentively as if a miracle will soon happen that they might know how it started.
When it came to the stage where Baal prophets cut themselves, I can see from the face of older ones that they are making a certain kind of reflection of how people worship idols in their own area. As the story reached were Elijah prepared his own sacrifice and when fire started to consume Elijah’s sacrifice and how people fell on their faces to

proclaim that God is lord, people were so happy that they clapped their hands and started to laugh and praise God for what he has done.
During our discussion of questions and answers these people talked freely as if they have been doing it before; culture and traditions that allow men to talk first were ignored because of [their] Christian way of life. They support that those worshipping idols should always be disappointed. They were also happy to retell the story to another person. As the storying session was in progress, the people in the church were very attentive and did not want any movement or disturbance. They tried their best to make the children to be silent. Men and women were so open to talk, the children were silent and did not contribute. The joy in their faces gave me the opportunity to ask more questions which they answered with all openness.
I know that God had really touched the hearts of these people from their actions, but I am not recommending storying session to be on Sundays, for this system really carried them away and if the Sunday School is not well conducted it will have a side effect on the worship services. In all, the session has been spiritually interesting to all that were in the Sunday School.”
The following Sunday he told the story of Cain and Abel just before the sermon as a way of helping people know how to worship properly. Here’s part of what happened. “The people got settled down very attentively, including the children, just to know
how the story will end and what lessons to learn there. At the stage where the sacrifices were offered, I could see that some people could read this into their own life, if they have also offered good or bad things to God.
“At the point where Cain killed Abel there was a great shout from the congregation cursing Cain for his action. The story was disturbed for some time as people could not hide their feelings and the women showed the feeling of losing a child. These reactions showed that Cain’s action was not pleasing and the punishment from God was proper, yet they said repentance and forgiveness is necessary.”
In the discussion they paid a lot of attention to the consequences of disputes between children and the terrible experience of the death of a child. The fear produced by this story will make the parents pay more attention to their children when they have problems. The people also talked about finding a way to make reconciliation so that

people will not resort to killing to resolve their conflicts. They learned that “jealousy should not bring damage or destruction to our fellow men and when we know our weakness let us make an adjustment.”
“One observation [from Ezekiel] was that this story session seems a new and the church enjoyed it, even myself. It brings a new focus into Christians’ life, better understanding of the Bible, but this can be better done in groups during the week where people could take part fully in the discussion. In any time of Sunday if it is done there is need for hurry not to let it affect other programmes.”
Student 6 (Dip.Th. 2)
Told the Call of Samuel in adult SS in his church because SS materials had not yet arrived (a common situation among my students; several seized on this problem as an opportunity to try their new method) “ . . . they enjoyed [storying] even more than the time we have been meeting together to study.”
“ . . . they were able to answer correctly, which shows me that they really understand the story very well. Also about four of them were bold to retell the story when I asked them to do.”
“They also asked some critical and sensitive questions from the story and outside the story but that related to it. . . . During the time of our reflection everybody talked freely and were excited, and I also discovered that they were able to get the message I am passing through. Though they asked for more that same day but I told them and promised them another time.”
The next week he met with the same group to tell Jesus’ Temptation. “The story Reveals to them deep things they did not know, for instance how to respond to temptation and seeing or examined how Jesus responded to temptation gave them new idea of light. I got to know this in the reflection and questions they asked.” The way they corrected the errors of those who retold the story showed a good grasp of it. “At the end of the story they confessed their sins and told me how they have responded to temptation before. They were really opened and promised not to play with sin anymore.”
“I like the storytelling approach. It opens my church members’ eyes to be serious about their Bible. It also helped me to know some things that I did not take note of before, and I know it will still continue to help me because I will still continue to tell the

story to every individual or group that I am opportune to tell. I will adopt the system in my preaching also as from now on.”
Student 7
With Igede villagers in an open courtyard after the evening meal (a correction of a mistake he made the first time, by beginning before the mealtime and then the men called their wives out of the session to prepare food).
After telling the story of the birth of Isaac, he gave a chance for someone to retell it. “I was surprised that he perfectly reproduced the story. I was very happy because I could see that the major themes were caught by the people. In the questions I asked, many facts were mentioned, many truths and lesson discovered and applied to our daily lives. In fact, the old way of greeting that shows more respect which some of this tribe have forgotten or is not known by many young ones was discovered on that day when we considered how Abraham culturally and respectfully greeted the visitors. . . . Nobody left until the end of everything. . . . One of those husbands who called their wives last week came today and he said he was really blessed, he even promised to be attending always. Marvellously, I myself was really blessed.”
The short-term nature of the course I taught did not allow me to gather long-term data about the effectiveness of the method in Nigeria. But judging from responses like these, storying seems to have struck a responsive chord in the listeners and to have surprised some students with its impact on participants.
In southern Sudan Baptists provided two teachers (a Kenyan pastor and an American missionary) and a curriculum to a struggling training center run by the Episcopal Church of Sudan. During a two-year residential program under very difficult living conditions, the students mastered 135 stories from the Bible. They were tested weekly on their ability to tell the new stories learned, to sing the story-songs that they composed to go with each story, and to act out the stories in a drama. The music was vitally important in making learning fun and easier. It also turned out that the students preferred to initiate ministry via the story-songs and then tell the biblical stories. The songs gathered a crowd, who immediately joined in the singing, and then subsequently asked the students to elaborate

what stories the songs were telling. When we interviewed the seventeen graduating students shortly before graduation, three of us asked 70 factual questions about the Bible and theology. Students answered correctly 85% of the time. The questions that they answered wrongly were frequently matters that they had not addressed in their training, such as “what is Jesus doing currently?” None knew he is making intercession for believers. Whenever we asked students to tell one of the biblical stories that they had learned, they were able to do so. They sang for us a song that named all sixty Old Testament stories in chronological order.
When we asked about their use of their training, they reported that during month- long breaks from school they frequently sang the songs and told any of the stories that the group did not know. These song/story sessions often lasted several hours. Multiple students told of continuing into the wee hours of the morning or even until dawn. The village chief commended the training program for bringing these new songs into the culture; they provided an alternative to the taunt songs that were frequent instigators of bloodshed, especially when they were sung at celebrations where alcohol flowed freely.
The training process in Sudan was largely modeled after western classroom instruction. Students met 3-4 hours five mornings per week. The teachers modeled telling the story (through a translator) and the students then dialoged with the teachers about the interpretation and significance of the story. Students then practiced the stories in pairs (a weak student with a strong one), collaborated in composing the songs, learned them and created dramas, etc. There was weekly testing. Students were encouraged to use the new stories away from the village in ministry settings, but this was done only sporadically. Transportation and food were hard to come by. The training would have had more practical impact, we think, if students had been able to use it immediately in actual ministry instead of the rather contrived setting of the classroom.
In [South Asia], Bible storying has been used in a number of different ways over the last decade. Agricultural students have learned about thirty stories to use in evangelism. (Women have learned short story sets during health and home garden training.) Stories have been broadcast via radio and radio listener groups used to discuss the broadcast stories, give personal ministry, and congregationalize the converts. Last year that group began more than one new church per day, on average. They have since

reached across their cultural lines to four other cultural groups. This has been done with only one missionary couple helping facilitate the work and only half a dozen Bible- college trained nationals giving oversight to the ministry and developing new story resources. The training has been very practical, with far less academic and classroom atmosphere than in Sudan. The extent of the training has also been less. Even at that the challenge has been to keep it simple enough for illiterate farmers to use it. The leaders of the training say it is a constant struggle to keep technical vocabulary and religious jargon out of the training—but that is key to their effectiveness because their farmer-pastors do not in any way appear to be religious professionals. Nor has the training educated them out of their oral, rural culture. [Activists for the majority religion] in the area have successfully chased most expatriate missionaries out of the region, but they are baffled at their inability to stem the growth of this Christian group, let alone chase them out.

YouVersion Reading Plans are supplemental pathways for bible app users to engage with scripture. The goal for each Reading Plan is to help app users dive deeper into God’s Word. The YouVersion bible app has an extremely large reach globally and has been installed on more than 250 million different mobile devices. The app contains scripture content in more than 1,000 languages and more than 27 million users have completed Reading Plans.
Many of the languages represented in the app have the bible or scripture portions, but do not have a wide variety on Reading Plans. Our organization has a partnership with YouVersion to produce Reading Plan content to be shared through the app. This partnership could be a great resource for teams wanting to create scripture engagement tools for use in discipleship, healthy church formation or leadership development. Topical categories for Reading Plan content include, but are not limited to: anger, families, forgiveness, healing, marriage, christian living and doubt.
Discovering Jesus is a 5-Day Reading Plan created by the Scripture Engagement Team using video clips from the Savior Film. This plan was initially created in Arabic and is being translated by field teams for use in their context. If you would like to adapt the Discovering Jesus plan for your context, or create new Reading Plan content, contact the Scripture Engagement team.

Overview
Bible-based trauma healing programs equip
local churches to care for people with deep
emotional and spiritual injuries caused by war,
domestic violence, natural disasters and other
traumatic events. Trauma Healing programs
equip local church leaders to apply biblical
and mental health resources into an effective
intervention session that fosters healing, and restores relationships with God and others. Facilitators lead small groups in a participatory process to help hurting people identify and bring their pain to God. Then they are invited to bring their pain to the cross of Christ for healing. As they release their pain, they are often able to forgive and sometimes can be reconciled with those who have inflicted the pain.
The program is based on a workbook called Healing the Wounds of Trauma. This book provides basic mental health concepts within a biblical framework, using scripture passages and composite real-life stories to help people connect the teaching with their circumstances. It has been used with tens of thousands of pastors, counselors and traumatized people around the world and is available in over 150 languages.
The Trauma Healing Institute, of the American Bible Society, developed the training materials for the program, and conducts a training and certification process for workers wanting to lead trauma healing programs or train local leaders. The Scripture Engagement team has trained facilitators that can equip your team to facilitate trauma healing programs, and train leaders. If you are interested implementing trauma healing programs in your strategy, contact the Scripture Engagement team for more information.

Introduction
Development of The New Life [Nolosha Cusub] website began in April, 2006 with the intention of clearly presenting the Gospel message to Somali speakers worldwide. Since Somalis share the Muslim mindset associating religious practice to a supposedly ""holy language"" of Quranic Arabic, the website’s aim is to exemplify the Pentecost freedom that believers have to worship God in their mother tongue. The website is essentially entirely in Somali, demonstrating that one does not need to learn any other language [e.g. English] in order to be a disciple of Christ. Nearly all of the written and audio material on this website has been previously broadcast or distributed by The Voice of New Life [Codka Nolosha Cusub] shortwave broadcast. VNL has been on the air since 1974, and is well known by several generations of Somalis.
The purpose of this manual is to help non-Somali speaking Christians to be able to enhance their Somali friend’s usage of The New Life website. While the English equivalent of menu titles can be seen when the cursor hovers over them, the documentation presented here is much more detailed.
In this “Users Manual” the most detail will be given to actual pages
containing a given set of resources. In order to save space, intermediate pages will sometimes be skipped. The name of each page has been
converted to hypertext so that clicking on it will reach the corresponding URL.
HOYGA [HOMEPAGE]
The homepage currently features a
blog series “The promises of God” highlighting redemption history. During key days of the church calendar [e.g. Holy Week, Ascension Day, Pentecost, Advent] explanatory messages are displayed that the give the Biblical context. A special sidebar at right is sometimes displayed to highlight new
materials posted or to focus on special events.
On the homepage, there are six major menu tabs. Let’s check out contents, moving from left to right.

 QORAAL
[Literature] contains three subdivisions: 1. Aqoondirsad [Bible Correspondence Courses]
2. Qoraal Gaaban [Tracts & miscellaneous items]
3. Suugaan[Poetry] AQOONDIRSAD
[Correspondence Courses]
The two series presented here allow visitors to study Scripture at their own pace. Both series have quizzes at the conclusion of chapters can be sent in for correction by the New Life website follow up staff.
1. Basic series:
ILAAH KELIYA IYO JID KELIYA
[One God, One Way by Kevin G. Dyer]
Twelve basic lessons covering the Bible from Genesis to Revelations. Hard copy in Somali can be ordered from:
Multi-Language Media
P.O. Box 301, Ephrata, PA 17522 USA
! 717-738-0582 F: 717-738-9905 http://www.multilanguage.com/

https://www.ecsministries.org/159994.ihtml
            
The New Life User Manual v2.1 4
 It is important that the lessons be studied in sequence; some website visitors randomly submit quizzes without beginning with Lesson 1. In this series, the final quiz appears at the bottom of the final screen. At the end of Lesson 1, detailed instructions in this text box are given on how to correctly complete the quiz. Each quiz begins with 5 multiple choice questions, then 3 short answer questions and ends with 2 true/false
questions. The form is designed so that it cannot be submitted [by clicking on the Riix oo dir button] until each question has been completed and an email address placed in the appropriate field. The box Su’aal ama Ray’i [Question or Comment] is often used by those complete quizzes to write messages, either brief or lengthy.
From 21 years experience in using this series with radio listeners [both as hard copy and as individual chapters sent as emails], most who complete this course average 80-90% on quizzes. Lower scores indicate either that a person is barely literate or else that they have not carefully read through a given lesson. This pattern has also been confirmed in the past three years experience with website visitors.
 2. Advanced series:
WIXII AAN KA MAQALNAY NEBIYADA
[We Hear From The Prophets]
This course is written at a more advanced level than IKJK, requiring considerably more studying and reflection. Participants are repeatedly challenged to pray about what they are learning. Each of the eight chapters focuses on one the following Biblical characters:
Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses, David, Isaiah, John the Baptist and Jesus Christ.
  Hard copy of this series in Somali can be ordered from Multi-Language Media [see page 3].
For the English original, contact:
Gospel Publishing House
1445 N. Boonville Avenue
Springfield, MO 65802-1894 !1(800) 641-4310 http://gospelpublishing.com/store/startitem.cfm?item=427012&cat=GPINDEX&mastercat=&path=GPINDEX
 
                                                                       The New Life User Manual v2.1 5
Due to the length of this course, each of the eight chapters is divided into 4- 7 Qaybta [Sections]. Visitors can access any section by clicking on its number at the top of the page, or at the bottom of the self-test Leyli [Quiz] that ends each section.
                      After finishing a section, the student should complete the self-test Quiz. Following that, by clicking Jawaabta i tus [Show me the answer] he/she can compare with the correct answers.
        The final Imtixaanka [Test] at the conclusion of each chapter follows the pattern of 5 multiple choice, 4
true/false and 6 short answer questions. As with “One God, One Way”, all 15 questions must have been completed before the form can be submitted for grading. Again, this is accomplished by clicking on the Riix oo dir button.
Due to the complexity of this course, and the adverse effects of 20+ years of civil war on the Somali educational system, very few courses from this
advanced series have been completed by radio listeners. As of September 2010, only four have been completed by website visitors.
This series offers serious, in-depth Bible study written for people from a Muslim background. It can be a valuable resource in a discipling relationship. However, some coaching/assistance will greatly increase the chances of successful completion. It is advisable that a student do only one section per day; in this way a chapter could be completed within one week. If you have the English edition available, you can personalize/adapt much of the material, particularly in the self-test quizzes at the ends of each section.

QORAAL GAABAN
[Tracts & Short Writings]
A variety of short writings are available:
• QIRASHADA IIMAANKA [The Apostles Creed]
• BARYADA RABBIGA [The Lord’s Prayer]
• MARAGFURKA SHAHIIDKII MEHDI DIBAAJ [The
testimony of martyr Mehdi Dibaj]

Three tracts from LifeWords/SGM are available with flash animation: Masiixinimo [Christianity?] A basic explanation of Christianity.
Waxba ha ka cabsan [Do not be afraid] Encouraging Scriptures for dealing with fear of illness, death, violence, occult, etc.
Diin oo keliya? [Religion only?] Stresses taking care of widows and orphans with contemporary African HIV/AIDS pandemic.
SUUGAAN [Poetry]
Currently, five poems are available. The first two were written in 2008 by an underground Christian inside Somalia who has been listening to The Voice of New Life broadcast for years. The other three are text to hymns available on the CODADKA IFTIINKA-1[page 9]; they date to the 1970s and 1980s. This section of Literature will become very important. Poetry plays a much more prominent role in Somali society than in Western culture. As additional Christian poems are received, they will be checked for content, formatted and posted here.

QASIIDOOYIN [Hymn Albums]
QASIIDOOYIN ILAAH AMMAAN AH
[Hymns for the Praise of God]
This album of four male musicians accompanied by acoustic guitar was recorded digitally in Nairobi in 1993. The 1st 30 tracks here are found in the Somali hymnbook by the same name (available from Multi- Language Media, see page 3).
CODADKA IFTIINKA-1
[Voices of Light Vol. 1]
This album was completed in 2001. Of the 15 tracks, 8 are found in the QIAA hymnbook. However, 3 of these were not recorded in the QIAA album since their tunes had been lost at that time. The other 7 were entirely new compositions by two Somali Christian artists. A variety of both male and female voices are featured; instrumentation is mainly
synthesizer and keyboard, with some lute. This CD has been widely distributed around the world and has been well received by Muslim as well as Christian Somalis. (To purchase a CD along with text in Somali and English, contact Multi-Language Media, page 3).
CODADKA IFTIINKA-2
[Voices of Light Vol. 2]
This album was recorded by the same group as the Codadka Iftiinka-1. Of the 7 tracks, 6 are found in QIAA hymnbook [1 of these was not included in the QIAA album since the tune was not known in 1993].
QASIIDOOYIN QADIIMI AH
[Ancient Hymns]
These four hymns were written by members of a small Roman Catholic Somali congregation in Jigjiga, Ethiopia in the 1930s. They were recorded a cappella by one of their descendants of that group in Addis Abeba in 2002. An acoustic guitar track was later mixed in.

KARTUUN [Cartoons]
Two of the original Jungle Doctor stories were translated into Somali and printed as comic books in 1980. These images have been scanned, and a sound track was recorded with the VNL team in Addis Abeba in 2009. Both contain a clear Gospel call in the final frames, so it is best to have parents view it initially.
DERBIGII WEYNAA [The Great Wall] ISKA JIRA DABINO [Beware of Traps]
QASIIDOOYIN-FIIDAYAW AH [Hymn videos]
Two hymns [Tracks 1 & 12 from Codadka Iftiinka-1] are
presented along with scenes of rural and urban life in pre- war Somalia. Currently, both hymns are on the same page; however, as additional are uploaded, they will be displayed on separate pages.

Tips on Bible reading
Each book has a small window at top- center with a drop-down list of chapters for a given book. For example, if one would want to go to Genesis 15, clicking on that number would bring one there immediately.
                                At the bottom of each chapter is a link Dib u celi bilawga [Return to beginning] that can be clicked to bring one directly back to beginning of a book.

BOGAG AF-CARBEED [Arabic Websites]
Probably less than 10% of all Somalis are fluent in Arabic. However, this proportion is higher among Internet users. Furthermore, most Somalis have had some experience learning Quranic Arabic. As Arabic is assumed to be the holy language of Islam, the Christian sites presented here clearly challenge preconceived ideas. Three links are related to www.arabicbible.com/ [Arabic, but with some English]; considerable audio as well as written material is presented. www.waterlive.org/ has the
entire Arabic Bible presented with parallel English text. www.alnour.com/ is particularly focused on presenting the Gospel to Muslims. www.thirdmill.org/arabic/ contains the Arabic language pages of Third Millennium Ministries.
            BOGAG AF-SOOMAALI [Somali Websites]
SOMALI CHRISTIAN MINISTRIES is a website operated in Toronto by Canadian Christians with some input from Somalis. It contains both written and audio materials.

The New Life User Manual v2.1 15
Appendix 1. Downloading of the Bible to cell phones
[based largely on material provided by David Haslam of Go Bible]
General points.
For both the .JAR file and the .ZIP file, it is very sensible to first download the file to a PC. For most users this will be the preferred
option, because they will either have access to a broadband connection (for which the download speed is very fast) or access to a dial-up modem
connection (for which the download speed is slower). Both methods will generally be MUCH cheaper than downloading wirelessly from the internet direct to a cell phone. The foot of the main Go Bible page contains this warning: ""Note: Downloading via your phone may incur data charges. You may want to find out how much you pay for data before downloading Go Bible over the air as it is a 1.4MB download.""
The ZIP file version merely packages the .JAR file and the .JAD file such that they can be downloaded to a PC in a single operation. Once downloaded, the user will need to decompress the ZIP file (using e.g. WinZip or PKUNZIP, or IZarc, or 7-Zip, or any other choice from plethora of similar utilities). This is usually known as Extracting a file from a compressed archive (ZIP) file.
The next point is more technical.
For most cell phone models, only the .JAR file needs to be copied to the phone, in order to install the application. Most cell phones do not need the .JAD file, but some do. However, it is impossible to provide a list of all models that would need the .JAD file.
The next point is even more technical.
There are three possible methods to copy a .JAR file (or any other file type) from a PC to a cell phone:
1. By means of the USB cable normally supplied by the phone manufacturer (or accessories shop). For some brands, special software is required.
2. Using Bluetooth wireless connection, for cell phones that have Bluetooth, from a PC that has Bluetooth built-in, or using a suitable ""off-the-shelf"" hardware adaptor for Bluetooth.
3. More rarely than either, using an Infra-Red wireless connection, which requires a ""line of sight"" between the PC infrared transmitter and the cell phone receiver.
Let's assume that the .JAR file is now somewhere in the cell phone memory, or its plug-in extended memory card.
The next question is ""how to install it?""
For some phone models this question does not arise, because the phone filer system will automatically install a .JAR file when it is received. For the rest, the user will have to browse through the phone's file system until they find the .JAR file, and then click on the phone menu option to Install.
For some cell phone models, even the phone folder location the .JAR file was copied to from the PC is critical. That's one for consulting the cell phone user manual. From this point on, it is usually plain sailing, though we still occasionally get questions about issues that arise even at this stage.
   
The New Life User Manual v2.1 16
The next points are much more technical.
How to install direct from the internet to the cell phone ""over the air"" (OTA)? Though for some phone models, it may be feasible to just browse from the cell
phone browser to the site, and click on the .JAR file, this may not be successful for many other phone models. At present the noloshacusub.net site is not configured to provide ""Wireless Application Protocol"" (WAP) downloads using WML pages [we may be able to address this in the future].
Separate download for 512KB or 1MB collections.
This is required to enable owners of phones with a JAR file size restriction to install the Bible in parts rather than as a whole. This capability will hopefully be soon available at our website.

Overview
Reading App Builder helps you build customized apps for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. You can use it to make apps containing picture books, health and community development
materials, song books, illustrated stories and libraries of easy-to-read books for new readers – each with the option of synchronizing text and audio, highlighting each phrase as it is read. The app menus, icon, splash screen and colors can all be customized for your language and culture.
To build an app, you specify the text and audio files, the app name, the fonts, the colors, the about box information and the icons. Reading App Builder will package everything together and compile the customized app for you. You can then install it on your mobile device, send it to others by Bluetooth, share it on microSD memory cards and publish it to app stores on the Internet.
Reading App Builder can be a useful tool for teams wanting to engage literate and semi-literate people groups with the Gospel, Christ-themed content or stories from their community. The Scripture Engagement team is ready to assist any team that would like to produce an app using Reading App Builder. We can also work with you to facilitate the whole process of gathering content, creating the app, publishing to app stores.

 Evangelism
 Discipleship
   Find & Understand
▪ Understanding people groups
▪ Understanding levels of evangelization ▪ Understanding Bible translation
▪ Understanding the GCC network
Get to them
▪ Explore political, economic, religious environment
▪ Explore access options
▪ Acquire necessary skills and/or
resources
Develop an ability to communicate with them
▪ Language (almost always cannot be
done in English.)
▪ Culture
  ▪ No salvation apart from hearing and believing the gospel
▪ Making disciples starts with sharing the gospel
▪ Evangelism is non-negotiable ▪ Some are gifted
▪ All are responsible
▪ Gospel message must be faithful to Scripture and understandable
▪ Role of language and worldview
▪ If there is no evangelism, it is not
missions
  ▪ Goal is disciples, not “converts”
▪ Disciple = learner/follower of Jesus
who is being transformed by the Holy Spirit to be conformed to the image of Christ
▪ This includes knowledge of Scripture
▪ This includes transformation of
character
▪ This includes development of skills like
Bible study, prayer, evangelism
▪ This is a lifelong process
 Health Church Formation
 Leadership Training
 Partnership & Exit
   ▪ Discipleship normally happens in a local church
▪ Local church is the automatic, natural home of a healthy disciple of Jesus
▪ Where there are none, we must start
churches
▪ This was the consistent practice of
apostles
▪ Even where there are churches, it
always good to start new churches
  ▪ The goal with new churches is maturity ▪ Self-governing, self-supporting, self-
propagating
▪ Fully able to understand, teach, and
obey the Word of God
▪ Leaders need to be trained
▪ Know/Be/Do: knowledge, character,
skills
▪ Initial stages are simply discipleship,
and this is critically important
▪ Biblical qualifications are primarily
exemplary, what every disciple
should be
▪ Also able to teach
▪ Knowledge of content, interpretation, application of Bible, along with theology
▪ Character includes maturity, humility, and integrity
▪ Skills include teaching, shepherding, evangelizing, discipline
▪ All should be taught carefully and rigorously
▪ All can be taught non-traditionally in context of local church
  ▪ The goal is not to be there forever
▪ Stay too long, and you develop
unhealthy dependence
▪ Stay too short, and you leave new
believers/churches as prey to wolves; look to the phased process of Model, Assist, Watch, and Leave
▪ Example of Paul included ongoing involvement even after physically leaving
▪ Example of apostles also included partnership in the gospel
▪ Take them with you as you go!
